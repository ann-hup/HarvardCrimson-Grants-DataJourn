# Project: The Harvard Crimson, Technology Board, Data Journalism: NSF and NIH Grants Project (R, Python) 
## Contributors: Annika Huprikar, Samuel Lin, Leonard Tang

In this project, we looked at funding given to Harvard University from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) and compared the Harvard-specific funding data with the national averages/medians/etc. of funding amounts given by the NSF and NIH overall, and overtime. 

A specific outline of our methodology is included in the repo as a PDF file. Our data visualization and analysis was conducted in R and Python.

An article presented by the News Board of the Harvard Crimson was pitched to focus on this topic, and our findings from this project are intended to support the article's content and the journalist's needs.
